# arch-installer
A python based instaler for Arch. It makes no sense that, even though the installation guide has not changed, arch still has no installer. That is why I decided to make one.

## Requirements
The following software is required to be installed:

- python
- libparted

## Features

### Currently implemented

Currently the following features have been included:

- Listing disks
- Removing partitions
- Creating a new partition
